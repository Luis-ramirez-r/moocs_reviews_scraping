I have never come across Android ,iOS and Windows apps or marketing offers of any value, so I was very skeptical, and wouldn't have even bothered to register if I wasn't waiting for download to complete and didn't have anything to do in the meanwhile.  

I have been so disgusted with worthless offers and apps that I would usually block the sites, but this to my pleasant surprise turned out to be even better than what I would expect from formal professional course.

I'm giving it 5 stars because it pays attention to small little details like the subscripts for PV which doesn't have a subscript because it is always for the year-zero, and C (capital) which has a subscript of 0 when calculating future values and a subscript equal to the number of years when calculating a present value.

It also clarifies that ""r"" is a return, not an interest percentage, so a decimal value, and that the exponent is also equal to the compounding or discounting period because the periods are marked at the end of each year and you have the same value multiplying (compounding) or dividing (discounting) the earlier value. 

It also helped establish the difference between discounting and compounding, how we could tell from problems if we needed to compound or discount, and why one was a multiplication and the other a division.

Aside from that, examples that forensically looked at calculations and asked you to ascertain what the periods and interest rates were helped you look at the problems from every possible angle and for each possible scenario for a complete comprehension of the underlying concepts.

Most text books won't pay attention to the subscripts for the present value which doesn't need a subscript since all values are discounted to time zero, but since the cash flows are progressive, they do need a subscript.

It is a great introductory course to Linear Programming, focusing on mixed and integer programming, and with final modules on sensitivity reports and non-linear programming.
